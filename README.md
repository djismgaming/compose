# Compose
docker-compose files for fast server deployment with docker containers
- can be used in (so far I've tested)
  - linux with docker
  - windows with docker desktop
  - macOS with docker desktop

## Getting Started
Just copy this YAML to any directory in your system 
https://github.com/djismgaming/compose/blob/main/docker-compose.yml
and run docker-compose up -d


## Cleaning the yaml comments to leave a clean docker-compose file
(this is not required in order to use the YAML file with docker-compose)

These instructions are for use in Notepad++, my favorite editor in Windows :D
